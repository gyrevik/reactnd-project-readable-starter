# Readable API Server

This is the final assessment project for Udacity's Redux course which is a content and comment web app. Users can post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users can also edit and delete posts and comments.

This repository includes the code for the backend API Server that was used to develop and interact with the front-end portion of the project.

# frontend

The frontend directory is a project that was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). Its puropose is to satisfy the requirements in the Udacity Project Readable - Project Overview. The project is forked from https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter

The code is here: https://github.com/gyrevik/reactnd-project-readable-starter
